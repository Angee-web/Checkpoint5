A landing page for an online furniture business
I used external .css file to style the html
I used tailwind to make the page responsive
I used media query to make the page fit and adjust to every screen size
I also included screenshots of the page on different screen sizes (above 768px and below 768px)
I used comments for a cleaner look and better understanding
